    "## Introduction \n",
    "\n",
    "MapReduce is a programming paradigm that enables the ability to scale across hundreds or thousands of servers for big data analytics. The underlying concept can be somewhat difficult to grasp, because this paradigm differs from the traditional programming practices. This lesson aims to present a simple yet intuitive account of MapReduce that we shall put into practice in upcoming labs. \n",
    "\n",
    "*In a nutshell, the term \"MapReduce\" refers to two distinct tasks. The first is the __Map__ job, which takes one set of data and transforms it into another set of data, where individual elements are broken down into tuples __(key/value pairs)__, while the __Reduce__ job takes the output from a map as input and combines those data tuples into a smaller set of tuples.*\n",

    "The MapReduce programming paradigm is designed to allow __parallel and distributed processing__  of large sets of data (also known as big data). MapReduce allows us to convert such big datasets into sets of __tuples__ as __key:value__ pairs, as we'll see shortly. These pairs are analogous to the data structures we saw with dictionaries and JSON files etc. These tuples are __mapped__ and __reduced__ in a computational environment to allow distributed execution of complex tasks on a group (cluster) of interconnected computers. \n",

    "> A distributed processing system is a group of computers in a network working in tandem to accomplish a task\n",
    "\n",
    "When computers are in a distributed system, they do not share hard drive memory or processing memory; they communicate with one other through messages, which are transferred over a network. The individual computers in this network are referred to as __nodes__. As you've seen before, computers can send requests as well as packets of data to one another.\n",
    "\n",
    "The two most common ways of organizing computers into a distributed system are the client-server system and peer-to-peer system.\n",
    "\n",
    "The client-server architecture has nodes that make requests to a central server. The server will then decide to accept or reject these requests and send additional methods out to the outer nodes.\n",

    "\n",

    "Even though individual processors are getting faster (remember [Moore's Law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law)), they will never have the ability to keep up with the amount of data we are able to produce. The best solution computer scientists have developed has been to use the power of __multiple processors__ to put them to the same task. When using a well-developed distributed system, multiple processors can accomplish tasks at a fraction of the time it would take for a single processor to accomplish. As noted in the picture below, if you can divide the work between multiple processors, everything will be more efficient. \n",
